# Using Rich Presence with the Embedded App SDK


When developing an [Activity](#TODO), the [Embedded App SDK](#TODO) makes it easy to integrate Rich Presence to display details about what a user is up to inside of your game or social experience. This guide provides an overview of the platform and technical knowledge you need to integrate Rich Presence with your existing Activity (with sample code provided!).

The rest of this guide assumes you've already developed an [app](#DOCS_QUICK_START_OVERVIEW_OF_APPS) that can launch an Activity. If you aren't at that point quite yet, you should follow the guide on [building your first Activity](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY) before continuing.

## Overview of Rich Presence in Embedded App SDK

TODO: commands that are important - probs setActivity + params

By default, when a user is connected to your Activity, it will display on their profile. 

TODO: no spectating or specific join

## Understanding Rich Presence Fields

TODO

## Updating Presence

TODO: intro setActivity
TODO: something about rpc.activities.write

You can update a connected user's Rich Presence data

### setActivity Fields

When calling `setActivity`, you can only use a subset of the [Activity object](#TODO) since some fields (like the ones related to spectating) aren't relevant to Activities. Below is a table with the available fields:

| field      | type    | description                                                                                                | example                                                    |
