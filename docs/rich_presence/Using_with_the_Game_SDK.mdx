# Introducing Rich Presence

> danger
> The SDK that this documentation references, [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc), has been deprecated in favor of our new [Discord GameSDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/getting-started). Replacement functionality for the Rich Presence SDK can be found in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/activities) of that SDK. This documentation can be referenced for education but does not entirely reflect the new SDK.

How easy is it for people to play your game together? With Rich Presence from Discord, it just got so easy, a ~~caveman~~ Junior Dev could do it.

If you are testing a game integration with Rich Presence, other users will be able to see it. Please create a private test account and do not join any public servers while testing your integration.

## Step 0: Get the SDK

> warn
> Please use our new Discord GameSDK. Read the documentation and get it [here](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/getting-started).

## So, how does it work?

We worked hard to make using Discord's Rich Presence system as easy as possible. All you need is our header file—what you will interact with—and our library—where we did all the hard work for you—and you are ready to roll!

In the header file, you'll find six event-emitting callbacks:

1. `ready()`
2. `errored()`
3. `disconnected()`
4. `joinGame()`
5. `spectateGame()`
6. `joinRequest()`

These six callbacks make up the entirety of what you need to implement. Behind the scenes, we do all the heavy lifting for you.

The header file also contains the `Discord_RunCallbacks()` function. This invokes any pending callbacks from Discord on the calling thread (it's thread safe!).

## Initialization

The first step in implementing Rich Presence is [creating an application](#APPLICATIONS). Once you've created your application, note and save your `Client ID`. You will need this to initialize the SDK; this value will be referred to throughout this documentation as both `client_id` and `application_id`. Next, scroll down to the bottom of your application's page and hit the button that says "Enable Rich Presence". This will allow you to upload assets to your dashboard for later use.

To begin, you'll register your callback functions to the six `DiscordEventHandlers` and then call `Discord_Initialize()` with your `APPLICATION_ID`. If your game is distributed via Steam, you should also pass your application's Steam ID so Discord can launch your game through Steam:

###### SDK Initialization Example

```c
void InitDiscord()
{
    DiscordEventHandlers handlers;
    memset(&handlers, 0, sizeof(handlers));
    handlers.ready = handleDiscordReady;
    handlers.errored = handleDiscordError;
    handlers.disconnected = handleDiscordDisconnected;
    handlers.joinGame = handleDiscordJoinGame;
    handlers.spectateGame = handleDiscordSpectateGame;
    handlers.joinRequest = handleDiscordJoinRequest;

    // Discord_Initialize(const char* applicationId, DiscordEventHandlers* handlers, int autoRegister, const char* optionalSteamId)
    Discord_Initialize("418562325121990661", &handlers, 1, "1234");
}
```

A quick breakdown on the `Discord_Initialize()` function:

- `applicationId`: your client_id/application_id
- `handlers`: the callback functions you registered for each Discord event
- `autoRegister`: whether or not to register an application protocol for your game on the player's computer—necessary to launch games from Discord
- `optionalSteamId`: your game's Steam application id, if your game is distributed on Steam

When you are ready to publish your integration, we recommend digging into the source code of the SDK and copying `discord_register.h`, `discord_register_win.cpp`, `discord_register_osx.m`, and `discord_register_linux.cpp` into your installation and update process. By registering your application protocols on installation and update, your players won't need to run the game before being able to interact with invites, Ask to Join, and spectating in Discord.

## Shutting Down

Don't leave so soon! But when you _do_ shut down your application, don't forget to call `Discord_Shutdown()`. This properly terminates the thread and allows your application to shut down cleanly.

If you don't want to register all your event handlers at initialization, you can do so dynamically with `Discord_UpdateHandlers()`; this will allow you to register a new set of event handlers. Be mindful that this will delete old handlers if they are not explicitly bound to your handlers struct when calling this function.

## Updating Presence

> warn
> Deprecated in favor of [Discord GameSDK ActivityManager.UpdateActivity()](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/updateactivity)

The core of Discord's Rich Presence SDK is the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` function. This is what sends your game data up to Discord to be seen and used by others. You should call `Discord_UpdatePresence()` any time something important in the presence payload changes.

`Discord_UpdatePresence()` has a rate limit of one update per 15 seconds. Developers do not need to do anything to handle this rate limit. The SDK will queue up any presence updates sent in that window and send the newest one once the client is free to do so. If you are sending presence updates very frequently and wondering why you don't see your Discord presence changing, that's why!

###### Update Presence Example

```c
void UpdatePresence()
{
    char buffer[256];
    DiscordRichPresence discordPresence;
    memset(&discordPresence, 0, sizeof(discordPresence));
    discordPresence.state = "In a Group";
    sprintf(buffer, "Ranked | Mode: %d", GameEngine.GetMode());
    discordPresence.details = buffer;
    discordPresence.endTimestamp = time(0) + 5 * 60;
    discordPresence.largeImageKey = "canary-large";
    discordPresence.smallImageKey = "ptb-small";
    discordPresence.partyId = GameEngine.GetPartyId();
    discordPresence.partySize = 1;
    discordPresence.partyMax = 6;
    discordPresence.matchSecret = "4b2fdce12f639de8bfa7e3591b71a0d679d7c93f";
    discordPresence.spectateSecret = "e7eb30d2ee025ed05c71ea495f770b76454ee4e0";
    discordPresence.instance = 1;
    Discord_UpdatePresence(&discordPresence);
}
```

Here's a handy image to see how these fields are actually displayed on a profile:

![Graphical representation of the legend for rich presence details](rp-legend.png)

| location                               | field name     | notes                                                                       |

## Joining

> warn
> Deprecated in favor of [Discord GameSDK ActivityManager.OnActivityJoin](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/onactivityjoin) and [Discord GameSDK ActivityManager.OnActivityJoinRequest](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/onactivityjoinrequest)

#### Relevant Callbacks:

`joinGame()`
`joinRequest()`

#### Relevant Payload Data:

`partyId`
`partySize`
`partyMax`
`joinSecret`

When you send the relevant payload data in the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` call, your player can invite a Discord chat channel to play with them. This invite is tied to the player's party information; if their `partyId` changes, the invite will expire. If their `partySize` and `partyMax` changes, the invite will add, remove, and fill up slots dynamically.

Other Discord users can click "Join" on the invitation. Their game will then launch, and the `joinGame()` callback will fire in their client with the inviting player's `joinSecret`. The client should reverse hash or otherwise unencrypt this secret and match the players together.

### Ask to Join

When Player B clicks the Ask to Join button on Player A's profile, the `joinRequest()` callback fires for Player A, sending the following data:

###### Ask to Join Payload

```c
typedef struct DiscordJoinRequest {
    char userId[32];
    char username[344];
    char discriminator[8];
    char avatar[128];
} DiscordJoinRequest;
```

###### Ask to Join Payload Fields

| parameter     | type      | description                                                                                                                         |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| userId        | char[24]  | the userId of the player asking to join                                                                                             |
| username      | char[344] | the username of the player asking to join                                                                                           |
| discriminator | char[8]   | the discriminator of the player asking to join                                                                                      |
| avatar\*      | char[128] | the avatar hash of the player asking to join—see [image formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting) for how to retrieve the image |

> warn
> `avatar` can be an empty string if the user has not uploaded an avatar to Discord

When it fires, your game should surface this data with a Yes or No choice for Player A to accept whether or not they wish to play with Player B. Then, call `Discord_Respond()` with Player B's `userId` and the appropriate response code:

###### Ask to Join Response Codes

| code                 | value |
|----------------------|-------|
| DISCORD_REPLY_NO     | 0     |
| DISCORD_REPLY_YES    | 1     |
| DISCORD_REPLY_IGNORE | 2     |

The Ask to Join request persists for 30 seconds after the request is received, regardless of whether you have called `Discord_RunCallbacks()` within that window. Therefore, keep these two points in mind:

- Ensure you call `Discord_RunCallbacks()` as frequently as possible to ensure your game client is up to date with any data from Discord
- If the player is in a state in which they cannot interact with an Ask to Join request—like in the middle of a match—you should not send a `joinSecret` in the presence payload

## Spectating

> warn
> Deprecated in favor of [Discord GameSDK ActivityManager.OnActivitySpectate](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/onactivityspectate)

#### Relevant Callbacks:

`spectateGame()`

#### Relevant Payload Data:

`spectateSecret`

When you send the relevant payload data in the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` call, your player will gain the ability to invite a Discord chat channel to spectate their game. This invite is tied to the `matchSecret` and will expire when it changes.

Other Discord users can click "Spectate" on the invitation. Their game will launch, and the `spectateGame()` callback will fire in their client with the original player's `spectateSecret`. The client should reverse hash or otherwise unencrypt this secret and spectate that player's game.

## Secrets

Security is of the utmost importance to us here at Discord, and we know it is for you, too. That's why we want to make sure that you properly understand `matchSecret`, `joinSecret`, and `spectateSecret` so that your game data is safe and secure over the wire.

To keep security on the up and up, Discord requires that you properly hash/encode/encrypt/put-a-padlock-on-and-swallow-the-key-but-wait-then-how-would-you-open-it your secrets.

Secrets are obfuscated data of your choosing. They could be match ids, player ids, lobby ids, etc. You should send us data that someone else's game client would need to join or spectate their friend. If you can't or don't want to support those actions, you don't need to send us secrets.

## Rich Presence Field Requirements

All fields in the `DiscordRichPresence` object are entirely optional. Anything you choose to omit simply won't be displayed; the UI will dynamically adapt from the full Rich Presence object all the way down to the basic presence view. We highly encourage you to include as many fields as you can to make your game as attractive and interactive for other players as possible. However, if you choose to be a bit more selective, here's a handy table for what each piece of Rich Presence requires:

###### Rich Presence Field Requirements

## Your New Developer Dashboard

Included with the launch of Rich Presence is an overhaul of Discord's Developer Dashboard. We want to make Rich Presence as easy as possible to use. Our first step is helping you ditch your CDN. You're welcome.

OK, well, not entirely. But! Discord _will_ host any and all artwork that you need to have the very richest of presences. Upload an image, tag it with a key—preferably one you can remember—and **bam**. It's ready for Rich Presence use. Head over to your [applications page](#APPLICATIONS) to check it out!

> warn
> **Asset keys are automatically normalized to lowercase**. Be mindful of this when referring to them in your code.

## A note on testing and Game Detection

If you don't see Rich Presence data in your profile while testing, make sure you don't have multiple instances of Discord running—if you do, your presence might be changing in one of those!

If you're testing on your own, we recommend [downloading two separate release channels](https://discord.com/download) of the Discord desktop client. You can log into the stable, public test, and canary builds with separate credentials, making testing easier for a single developer.

## So, what now?

Get to coding! We can't wait to see the awesome integration you come up with. If you need some quick questions answered, look no further than our [Rich Presence FAQ](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_OVERVIEW/faq). If you want to know how to make your integration the best it can be, read our [Best Practices Guide](#DOCS_BEST_PRACTICES_DESIGNING_YOUR_DATA_FOR_RICH_PRESENCE/). If you're ready to release, consult our [Launch Checklist](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_OVERVIEW/launch-checklist) and make sure you haven't missed anything!

## FAQ

Below are answers to some common questions about integrating Rich Presence with your game.

#### Q: I see "Playing MyGame", but no Rich Presence data.

There's a couple things that could be going on:

- If you're running two instances of the Discord client, check both!
- Double check that your `Discord_Initialize()` function is correct.

Throughout development, make sure you have your `errored()` and `disconnected()` callbacks hooked up for debugging. You can open up the console in Discord and look for errors pertaining to `SET_ACTIVITY` for more information as well.

#### Q: I'm not seeing Spectate buttons on my profile.

Make sure you applied for approval! If you want the Spectate button on your players' profiles, we require your integration to go through an approval process. If you have applied and have been approved and still don't see the buttons, check your Discord console for errors.

#### Q: What happens if someone has more than one game running that supports Rich Presence?

Due to recent changes in our infrastructure for support of multi-activities, the behavior of multiple connected Rich Presence apps has changed from what it was before. Previously, whichever application was focused would be the presence that was shown. With the recent changes, the application that connected _first_ is now displayed.

However, invite functionality across multiple connected applications now works no matter which app is display on a user's profile. For example, if you are hosting a Spotify listening party, playing Game A that allows you to send Join invites, and playing Game B that allows you to send Spectate invites, you'll be able to send invites to all three simultaneously!

#### Q: What if someone looking at my profile or an invite doesn't own the game?

Anyone can see your profile data, whether they own the game or not. They'll only be able to interact with chat invites or profile buttons if they own the game and have launched it at least once. Otherwise, the invite/button tooltip will show "Game Not Detected".

#### Q: Do join invitations allow players to select the number of open slots?

Currently, the SDK does not support this. Party slot information is determined by the party data you sent in your presence payload.

#### Q: Can I send images via the payload rather than uploading them to my Developer Dashboard?

Yes! In addition to uploading an asset and specifying its name, you can also specify an external image URL for us to proxy. For more information, see [Activity Asset Image](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/activity-object-activity-asset-image).

#### Q: Can I change something in the SDK for my own purposes?

Go nuts! The SDK is open source by design. If you need or want to change something for the purposes of your specific integration—like changing our JSON parser, or changing all of the variable names to the names of your pets—go ahead and tinker to your heart's content.

#### Q: OK—I've got it working! Now, how do I make my integration look _awesome_?

I'm happy ~~we preempted your question~~ you asked! Check out our [Rich Presence Best Practices](#DOCS_BEST_PRACTICES_DESIGNING_YOUR_DATA_FOR_RICH_PRESENCE/) guide for a rundown on how to make your integration the best that it can be!
