# Overview of Rich Presence

TODO: image


Rich Presence lets you display information in a Discord user's profile about what they're up to in your game or app. The data you choose to display is up to you—whether it's a user's score, duration they've been playing your game, what they're listening to in your app, or something else.

## Integrating Rich Presence

There are two main options for integrating Rich Presence with your game or app—what you're building will determine which to use:

- [Embedded App SDK](#TODO) can be used if you're building an [Activity](#TODO) and looking to integrate Rich Presence with it.
- [Game SDK](#TODO) can be used if you're building a 3rd party game or app outside of Discord.

> While we won't be detailing it here, you can also use the [`SET_ACTIVITY` RPC command](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/setactivity)

## Adding Rich Presence Images

While integrating Rich Presence, you'll need to upload images for your app.

Navigate to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and on the left hand sidebar, click **Rich Presence**. On the **Art Assets** page, there are two different types of image for your app.

> info
> For all Rich Presence images, `1024x1024` is the recommended dimensions dimensions to use.
