# Overview of Rich Presence

TODO: image - example of game and non-game (like listening)


Rich Presence lets you display information in a Discord user's profile about what they're up to in your game or app. The data you choose to display is up to you—whether it's a user's score, duration they've been playing your game, what they're listening to in your app, or something else.

> info 
> Rich Presence data appears publicly on your Discord profile, so during development you should use a test account that only belongs to your private development server(s).

## Choosing an SDK

There are two main options when integrating with Rich Presence—what you're building will determine which to use:

- **[Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_USING_WITH_THE_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK)** is used if you're building an [Activity](#TODO) in Discord.
- **[Game SDK](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_USING_WITH_THE_GAME_SDK)** can be used if you're building a 3rd party game or app outside of Discord.

Both SDKs use similar underlying primitives (like the [`SET_ACTIVITY` RPC command](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/setactivity) and [activity object](#TODO)), so the information on this page applies regardless of what or how you're building (unless otherwise noted).

## Adding Custom Art Assets

While integrating Rich Presence, you'll likely want to upload custom art assets for your app. **For all Rich Presence assets, it's highly recommended to make them 1024 x 1024**.

To add custom assets for Rich Presence, navigate to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click **Rich Presence** on the left-hand sidebar. On the **Art Assets** page, there are two different types of assets you can upload. 

### Invite Image

The Rich Presence invite image appears when [invites](#TODO) are sent for a 3rd party game or service using the [Game SDK](#TODO). After uploading an invite image for your app, you can see a preview of it to the right (under "IRL Invite Image Example").

> info 
> The invite image can be ignored if you're building an [Activity](#TODO) using the [Embedded App SDK](#TODO). Invites sent using the Embedded App SDK's[`openInviteDialog()`](#TODO) use the Activity's cover art.

### Assets

Up to 300 custom assets can be added for your app to use when setting Rich Presence for a Discord user. These assets can be anything that help orient others to what a user is doing inside of your Activity or 3rd party game.

If you need more than 300 custom assets or want to use images stored somewhere else, you can also [specify an external URL using the media proxy](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/activity-object-activity-asset-image) (as long it still has the proper dimensions and size).

> info
> For tips on choosing assets, take a look at the [Rich Presence best practices guide](#DOCS_BEST_PRACTICES_DESIGNING_YOUR_DATA_FOR_RICH_PRESENCE/have-interesting-expressive-art).

When uploading Rich Presence assets, **the asset keys will automatically be changed to lowercase**. You can see this reflected in your app's settings after saving a newly-uploaded asset, and should keep it in mind when referencing any asset keys in your code.
