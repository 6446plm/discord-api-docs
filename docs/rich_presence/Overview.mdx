# Overview of Rich Presence

## Launch Checklist

Ready to launch a Rich Presence integration for your game? Did you read our [Best Practices](#DOCS_BEST_PRACTICES_DESIGNING_YOUR_DATA_FOR_RICH_PRESENCE) guide? If so, we recommend looking over this checklist one last time to ensure that your integration is as great as it can be!

#### Profile Strings

- Have you made use of all available fields where appropriate?
- Do your strings fit on their own lines without line wrapping?
  - Did you check on the smaller profile pop out?
- Do they clearly communicate:
  - What the player is currently doing?
  - If the player is in a group or playing alone?
  - If the player is in a state where they can party up?

#### Artwork

- Is your artwork high resolution?
- Are your images at least 1024x1024 pixels?
- Is it clean, interesting, and descriptive without being too highly detailed?
- Do you have artwork for every different state? Don't forget your default state/main menu!
- Did you make use of tooltips and the small image where appropriate?

#### Joining

- Have you successfully implemented join invites for your game if applicable?
- Does the state of the invite properly represent the party/group in-game with regards to:
  - Size?
  - Open slots?
  - Discord _and_ non-Discord users in the party?
- Are you able to post invites to Discord without any additional in-game setup or configuration?
- Are you properly removing data from the presence payload when someone can no longer send invites?
  - A `joinSecret` should not be sent if the player can't invite anyone!

#### Spectating

- Have you successfully implemented spectate invites for your game if applicable?
- Is your game's spectate mode true spectating?
  - We do _not_ allow using the Spectate button as a pseudo-Join button.
- Are you properly removing data from the presence payload when someone can no longer spectate?
  - A `spectateSecret` should not be sent if the player can't be spectated!

## FAQ

Below are answers to some common questions about integrating Rich Presence with your game. If you don't see your question answered here, feel free to reach out to [gamedevs@discord.com](mailto:gamedevs@discord.com) for more help.

#### Q: I see "Playing MyGame", but no Rich Presence data.

There's a couple things that could be going on:

- If you're running two instances of the Discord client, check both!
- Double check that your `Discord_Initialize()` function is correct.

Throughout development, make sure you have your `errored()` and `disconnected()` callbacks hooked up for debugging. You can open up the console in Discord and look for errors pertaining to `SET_ACTIVITY` for more information as well.

#### Q: I'm not seeing Spectate buttons on my profile.

Make sure you applied for approval! If you want the Spectate button on your players' profiles, we require your integration to go through an approval process. If you have applied and have been approved and still don't see the buttons, check your Discord console for errors.

#### Q: What happens if someone has more than one game running that supports Rich Presence?

Due to recent changes in our infrastructure for support of multi-activities, the behavior of multiple connected Rich Presence apps has changed from what it was before. Previously, whichever application was focused would be the presence that was shown. With the recent changes, the application that connected _first_ is now displayed.

However, invite functionality across multiple connected applications now works no matter which app is display on a user's profile. For example, if you are hosting a Spotify listening party, playing Game A that allows you to send Join invites, and playing Game B that allows you to send Spectate invites, you'll be able to send invites to all three simultaneously!

#### Q: What if someone looking at my profile or an invite doesn't own the game?

Anyone can see your profile data, whether they own the game or not. They'll only be able to interact with chat invites or profile buttons if they own the game and have launched it at least once. Otherwise, the invite/button tooltip will show "Game Not Detected".

#### Q: Do join invitations allow players to select the number of open slots?

Currently, the SDK does not support this. Party slot information is determined by the party data you sent in your presence payload.

#### Q: Can I send images via the payload rather than uploading them to my Developer Dashboard?

Yes! In addition to uploading an asset and specifying its name, you can also specify an external image URL for us to proxy. For more information, see [Activity Asset Image](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/activity-object-activity-asset-image).

#### Q: Can I change something in the SDK for my own purposes?

Go nuts! The SDK is open source by design. If you need or want to change something for the purposes of your specific integration—like changing our JSON parser, or changing all of the variable names to the names of your pets—go ahead and tinker to your heart's content.

#### Q: OK—I've got it working! Now, how do I make my integration look _awesome_?

I'm happy ~~we preempted your question~~ you asked! Check out our [Rich Presence Best Practices](#DOCS_BEST_PRACTICES_DESIGNING_YOUR_DATA_FOR_RICH_PRESENCE/) guide for a rundown on how to make your integration the best that it can be!
